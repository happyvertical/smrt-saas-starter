# Upstream Work

Reusable starter functionality should continue to move upstream from isolated worktrees. Completed items are kept here so future starter work can see which package now owns each surface.

## Process

When starter work hits an upstream bug or a missing public API in a
`@happyvertical/*` package:

1. File an issue on the owning repo — `happyvertical/smrt` for `smrt-*`
   packages, `happyvertical/sdk` for the rest — with the package, version,
   starter context, and a minimal repro. No secrets or tokens.
2. Add the blocker under **Open Blockers** below with the issue link.
3. Wait for the fix to land upstream; do not work around it locally (no
   vendoring, forking, or patching `node_modules`). Continue with unblocked
   work in the meantime.
4. When the fix is released, bump the package version, validate with
   `pnpm check`, and move the entry to the completed sections below.

## Open Blockers

None.

## SDK: Stripe In `@happyvertical/accounting`

Status: complete in `@happyvertical/accounting@0.74.4` via [happyvertical/sdk#1041](https://github.com/happyvertical/sdk/pull/1041).

Covered surface:

- customers: create, retrieve, list, sync
- invoices: create, retrieve, list, send, void, sync
- payments: retrieve and list
- checkout sessions: create subscription checkout sessions
- customer portal sessions: create portal sessions
- webhooks: verify signatures and parse events
- subscription status retrieval: normalize Stripe subscription state for SMRT subscription rows

Validation:

```sh
pnpm --filter @happyvertical/accounting test
pnpm --filter @happyvertical/accounting typecheck
pnpm build
```

## SMRT: Tenant Metering

Status: initial tenant subscription metering is complete in `@happyvertical/smrt-subscriptions@0.27.12` via [happyvertical/smrt#1435](https://github.com/happyvertical/smrt/pull/1435), with the Postgres UUID migration fix from [happyvertical/smrt#1439](https://github.com/happyvertical/smrt/pull/1439).

Covered surface:

- persist tenant-aware usage metric records
- expose public APIs for recording and summarizing metric windows
- include `_smrt_ai_usage` in the same usage query surface
- support threshold windows used by subscription plans

## SMRT: Subscriptions

Status: complete in `@happyvertical/smrt-subscriptions@0.27.12` via [happyvertical/smrt#1435](https://github.com/happyvertical/smrt/pull/1435), with the Postgres UUID migration fix from [happyvertical/smrt#1439](https://github.com/happyvertical/smrt/pull/1439).

Covered surface:

- add `@happyvertical/smrt-subscriptions`
- models: subscription plan, plan feature, plan threshold, tenant subscription
- services: entitlement resolver, threshold evaluator, usage meter
- Svelte components: plan picker, current plan summary, usage thresholds
- generated REST/CLI/MCP surfaces

## SMRT Svelte: Right-Dock Chat Helpers

The starter uses `ToolsDock` directly. If more than one app repeats the same chat/MCP dock wiring, upstream a generic helper into `@happyvertical/smrt-svelte` or `@happyvertical/smrt-chat/svelte`.
